<p>Asutosh is very passionate about numbers. he has found a new type of numbers and calls them 'truncky numbers'.</p> 
<p>He has challenged his friend Shantanu to find the sum of first n truncky numbers. As shantanu is weak at programming,</p> 
<p>help him to complete his challenge.</p> 
<p>A Truncky number is defined as:-</p> 
<p>1) sum of digits in the number is of the form (5*k + 1) where k=number of digits.</p> 
<p>2)absolute difference between any two digits in the number is either 0 or 1.</p> 
<p>3)digits are in the non decreasing order.</p> 
<h3>Input</h3> 
<p>the first line contains T(number of test cases).Each test contains only one integer n.</p> 
<h3>Output</h3> 
<p>print in single line sum of first n truncky numbers modulo 10^9 + 7.</p> 
<p>Each output in new line.</p> 
<p>CONSTRAINTS:</p> 
<p>T&lt;=30</p> 
<p>N&lt;=10^17</p> 
<p> </p> 
<h3>Example</h3>
