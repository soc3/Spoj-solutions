<p> You are given an unweighted, undirected tree. Write a program to output the length of the longest path (from one node to another) in that tree. The length of a path in this case is number of edges we traverse from source to destination. </p> 
<h3>Input</h3> 
<p> The first line of the input file contains one integer <i>N</i> --- number of nodes in the tree (0 &lt; <i>N</i> &lt;= 10000). Next <i>N</i>-1 lines contain <i>N</i>-1 edges of that tree --- Each line contains a pair (<i>u</i>, <i>v</i>) means there is an edge between node <i>u</i> and node <i>v</i> (1 &lt;= <i>u</i>, <i>v</i> &lt;= <i>N</i>). </p> 
<h3>Output</h3> 
<p> Print the length of the longest path on one line. </p>
