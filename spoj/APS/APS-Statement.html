<p>Bablu is very fond of Series and Sequences...</p> 
<p>After studying Fibonacci Series in Class IX, he was impressed and he designed his own sequence as follows...</p> 
<p>a[0] = a[1] = 0 </p> 
<p>For n &gt; 1, a[n] = a[n - 1] + f(n), where f(n) is smallest prime factor of n.</p> 
<p>He is also very fond of programming and thus made a small program to find a[n], but since he is in Class IX, he is not very good at programming. So, he asks you for help. Your task is to find a[n] for the above sequence....</p> 
<h3>Input</h3> 
<p>Your code will be checked for multiple Test Cases.</p> 
<p>First Line of Input contains T (&lt;= 100), the number of Test Cases.</p> 
<p>Next T lines contain a single number N. (1 &lt; N &lt; 10^7).</p> 
<h3>Output</h3> 
<p>Single line containing a[n] i.e. nth number of the sequence for each test case.</p> 
<h3>Example</h3> 
<pre><strong>Input:</strong>
3
2
3
4

<strong>Output:</strong>
2
