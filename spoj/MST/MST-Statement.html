<p>Find the minimum spanning tree of the graph. </p>
<h3>Input</h3> 
<p>On the first line there will be two integers N - the number of nodes and M - the number of edges. (1 &lt;= N &lt;= 10000), (1 &lt;= M &lt;= 100000)<br> M lines follow with three integers i j k on each line representing an edge between node i and j with weight k. The IDs of the nodes are between 1 and n inclusive. The weight of each edge will be &lt;= 1000000. </p>
<h3>Output</h3> 
<p>Single number representing the total weight of the minimum spanning tree on this graph. There will be only one possible MST. </p>
