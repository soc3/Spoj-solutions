<p>A number is said to be made up of non-decreasing digits if all the digits to the left of any digit is less than or equal to that digit.For example, the four-digit number <strong>1234</strong> is composed of digits that are non-decreasing.  Some other four-digit numbers that are composed of non-decreasing digits are<strong> 0011</strong>, <strong>1111</strong>, <strong>1112</strong>, <strong>1122</strong>, <strong>2223</strong>.  As it turns out, there are exactly 715 four-digit numbers composed of non-decreasing digits. <br> <br>Notice that leading zeroes are required: 0000, 0001, 0002 are all valid four-digit numbers with non-decreasing digits. <br> <br>For this problem, you will write a program that determines how many such numbers there are with a specified number of digits.</p> 
<h3>Input</h3> 
<p>The first line of input contains a single integer P, (1 ? P ? 1000), which is the number of data sets that follow.  Each data set is a single line that contains the data set number, followed by a space, followed by a decimal integer giving the number of digits N, (1 ? N ? 64).</p> 
<h3>Output</h3> 
<p>For each data set there is one line of output.  It contains the data set number followed by a single space, followed by the number of N digit values that are composed entirely of non-decreasing digits.</p>
