<p><br>Farmer John tries to keep the cows sharp by letting them play with intellectual toys. One of the larger toys is the lights in the barn.  Each of the N (2 &lt;= N &lt;= 100,000) cow stalls conveniently numbered 1..N has a colorful light above it.<br><br>At the beginning of the evening, all the lights are off. The cows control the lights with a set of N pushbutton switches that toggle the lights; pushing switch i changes the state of light i from off to on or from on to off.<br><br>The cows read and execute a list of M (1 &lt;= M &lt;= 100,000) operations expressed as one of two integers (0 &lt;= operation &lt;= 1).<br><br>The first kind of operation (denoted by a 0 command) includes two subsequent integers S_i and E_i (1 &lt;= S_i &lt;= E_i &lt;= N) that indicate a starting switch and ending switch. They execute the operation by pushing each pushbutton from S_i through E_i inclusive exactly once.<br><br>The second kind of operation (denoted by a 1 command) asks the cows to count how many lights are on in the range given by two integers S_i and E_i (1 &lt;= S_i &lt;= E_i &lt;= N) which specify the inclusive range in which the cows should count the number of lights that are on.<br><br>Help FJ ensure the cows are getting the correct answer by processing the list and producing the proper counts.</p> 
<h3>Input</h3> 
<p><br>Line 1: Two space-separated integers: N and M<br>Lines 2..M+1: Each line represents an operation with three space-separated integers: operation, S_i, and E_i</p> 
<h3>Output</h3> 
<p>Lines 1..number of queries: For each output query, print the count as an integer by itself on a single line.</p>
