 Given the number of chocolates in both the boxes, let them be c1 and c2, the player takes either c1 or c2 number of chocolates and divide the remaining box of chocolates to two boxes (these two boxes need not have the same number of chocolates). The player who cannot make such a move loses.

 Given the initial number of chocolates (c1 and c2) find the winner.
