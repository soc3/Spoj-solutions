<p>Let S be the binary representation of an Integer. We define two functions a(i) and b(i) such that<br> a(i) = Number of occurrences of '1' at odd positions of S.<br> b(i) = Number of occurrences of '1' at even positions of S.<br> For example: for integer 19, S=10011.<br> so, a(19)=2 and b(19)=1</p> 
<h3>Input</h3> 
<p>First line contains an integer T. T=Number of test cases. Then T lines follow<br> On each line, you will be given three integers M,N,K.</p> 
<h3>Output</h3> 
<p>For each test case output a single integer R.<br> Where, R is the number of integers 'i' between M and N(both inclusive) such that absolute difference of a(i) and b(i) is equal to K.<br>Answer of each each test case should be on separate line</p>
