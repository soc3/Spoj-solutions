<p><strong>Have you felt bored when counting triangles?</strong> </p>
<p>Like TRICOUNT and TCOUNT2, we define the LEVEL of a triangle as in the following illustrative image:<br> </p>

<br> 
<p>And now we will continue defining the LEVEL of a hexagram. It's called level N hexagram if it’s joined by 12 triangles, each one is a level N triangle.<br> </p>

<br> 
<p><b>Task:</b> All you have to do is to count all triangles in the level N hexagram. </p>
<h3>Input</h3> 
<p>The first line of the input contains an integer T - the number of test cases and T lines follow. Each line contains an integer N which is the level of the hexagram in that test case. </p>
<h3>Output</h3> 
<p>For each test case, you should write a seperate line: the number of triangles in the level N hexagram. (All answers will fit within the range of a 64-bit positive integer) </p>
<h3>Example</h3>
