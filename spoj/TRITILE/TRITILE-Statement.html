<p><strong>Problem Statement</strong><br> Var is trying to find a new geometric shape with an even number of sides. She starts with an equilateral triangle and performs a series of n steps. At each step she adds an equilateral triangle to the outer sides of the shape she already has. Can you tell, if after n steps, her new shape will have even number of sides or not? <br><br> <strong>Input</strong><br> First line contains an integer T, denoting the number of test cases. Each test case contains an integer n, denoting the total number of steps she performs.<br><br> <strong>Output</strong><br> Print “Yes” if she ends up with a shape that has even number of sides, or print “No”.<br> <br> <strong>Constraints</strong><br> 1 &lt;= T &lt;= 100<br> 1 &lt;= n &lt;= 10 ^ 18<br> <br> <strong>Sample Input</strong><br> 1<br> 1<br> <br> <strong>Sample Output</strong><br> No<br> <strong>Explanation</strong><br> Original Triangle</p>

<p>As you can, see the number of edges is 3, which is odd.</p>
