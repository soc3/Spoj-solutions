<p>A number of cities are connected by a network of highways. Each highway is bidirectional and connects two cities, with a given travel time. What is the shortest time to get from a given city to another given city? </p>
<h3>Input</h3> 
<p>The first line of input contains the number of test cases.<br><br> Each test case starts with a line containing the number of cities n (2 ? n ? 100000), the number of highways m (1 ? m ? 100000), the starting city and the ending city. Cities are numbered from 1 to n.<br><br> Then m lines follow, each describing one highway. The description consists of the two distinct city numbers and the time in minutes to travel along the highway. The time will be between 1 and 1000.<br> </p>
<h3>Output</h3> 
<p>For each test case output a single line containing the minimum time it takes to get from the start to the destination. If no connection exists, output <tt>NONE</tt>. </p>
