<p>Rachu is very happy today beacause its his birthday :D and he has a bday party at home with 'r' friends.</p> 
<p>He went to market to purchase something to eat .(He is really fond of eating :P ).</p> 
<p>At the shop he found muffins at a very reasonable price (ohh!! he loves muffins ;) ).</p> 
<p>He bought 'n' muffins from the shop.</p> 
<p>After reaching home he is wondering that in how many ways  he can distribute these muffins between his friends .</p> 
<p>He shouldn't be rash so he would give atleast 1 muffin to each friend.</p> 
<p>For rest of the muffins left he can distribute it in any manner. He is still wondering the no. of ways in which he can distribute these muffins.</p> 
<p>Help him out by writing a code which calculates the no. of ways the muffins could be distributed and print "-1" (quotes for clarity) if its impossible for him to distribute the muffins.  <br><br> Consider each muffin as similar. The no. of ways could go very large so output the reult after taking a mod with 10000007 .</p> 
<h3>Input</h3> 
<p>The input consists of 2 integers :<br>  n : The no. of muffins<br>  r : The no. of friends</p> 
<h3>Output</h3> 
<p>The required answer modulo 10000007</p> 
<h3>Constraints</h3> 
<p>1&lt;= n,r &lt;= 100</p> 
<h3>Example</h3> 
<pre><strong>Input:</strong>
2 1

<strong>Output:</strong>
1<br><pre><strong>Input:</strong>
4 2

<strong>Output:</strong>
<br>3</pre>
<h3>Explanation</h3>
<p>In 1st case he has 2 muffins and called only 1 friend so he gave both the muffins to him .</p>
<p>In 2nd case he 1st give 1 muffin each to both.<br>Then he can give 0 muffin to 1st friend and 2 to the 2nd or 1 muffin to each or 2 muffins to 1st friend and 0 to the 2nd.</p>
