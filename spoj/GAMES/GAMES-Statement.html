Find the minimum number of games the player should have played to achieve that average.<br><br> The player can score any non-negative integer score in a game.<br><br> <strong>Input:</strong></p> 
<p>The first line consists of an integer t, the number of test cases. Each test case consists of a single <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rational_number"> Rational Number </a> which represents the average score of the player.</p> 
<p><br> <strong>Output:</strong><br><br> For each test case, find the minimum number of matches the player should have played to achieve that average.<br><br> <strong>Input Constraints:</strong><br><br> 1 &lt;= t &lt;= 1000<br> 1 &lt;= avg &lt;= 1000000 (maximum 4 digits after the decimal place)<br><br> <strong>Example:</strong></p>
