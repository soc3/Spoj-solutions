<p>Consider a list of numbers with two operations:</p> 
<ul> 
 <li>insert number — adds the specified number to the end of the list.</li> 
 <li>delete number — removes the first occurrence of the specified number from the list. If the list does not contain the number specified, no changes are performed.</li> 
</ul> 
<p>For example: the result of the insertion of a number 4 to the list [1, 2, 1] is the list [1, 2, 1, 4]. If we delete the number 1 from this list, we get the list [2, 1, 4], but if we delete the number 3 from the list [1, 2, 1, 4], the list stays unchanged.</p> 
<p>The list is homogeneous if it contains at least two equal numbers and the list is heterogeneous if it contains at least two different numbers. For example: the list [2, 2] is homogeneous, the list [2, 1, 4] is heterogeneous, the list [1, 2, 1, 4] is both, and the empty list is neither homogeneous nor heterogeneous.</p> 
<p>Write a program that handles a number of the operations insert and delete on the empty list and determines list’s homogeneity and heterogeneity after each operation.</p> 
<h3>Input</h3> 
<p>The first line of the input file contains an integer number n — the number of operations to handle (1 ? n ? 100 000).</p> 
<p>Following n lines contain one operation description each. The operation description consists of a word “<tt>insert</tt>” or “<tt>delete</tt>”, followed by an integer number k — the operation argument (?10^9 ? k ? 10^9 ).</p> 
<h3>Output</h3> 
<p>For each operation output a line, containing a single word, describing the state of the list after the operation:</p> 
<ul> 
 <li>“<tt>both</tt>” — if the list is both homogeneous and heterogeneous.</li> 
 <li>“<tt>homo</tt>” — if the list is homogeneous, but not heterogeneous.</li> 
 <li>“<tt>hetero</tt>” — if the list is heterogeneous, but not homogeneous.</li> 
 <li>“<tt>neither</tt>” — if the list is neither homogeneous nor heterogeneous.</li> 
</ul>
