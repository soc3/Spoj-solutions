<p> The ministers of the cabinet were quite upset by the message from the Chief of Security stating that they would all have to change the four-digit room numbers on their offices. <br> — It is a matter of security to change such things every now and then, to keep the enemy in the dark.<br> — But look, I have chosen my number 1033 for good reasons. I am the Prime minister, you know!<br> — I know, so therefore your new number 8179 is also a prime. You will just have to paste four new digits over the four old ones on your office door.<br> — No, it's not that simple. Suppose that I change the first digit to an 8, then the number will read 8033 which is not a prime!<br> — I see, being the prime minister you cannot stand having a non-prime number on your door even for a few seconds.<br> — Correct! So I must invent a scheme for going from 1033 to 8179 by a path of prime numbers where only one digit is changed from one prime to the next prime. </p>
<p> Now, the minister of finance, who had been eavesdropping, intervened.<br> — No unnecessary expenditure, please! I happen to know that the price of a digit is one pound.<br> — Hmm, in that case I need a computer program to minimize the cost. You don't know some very cheap software gurus, do you?<br> — In fact, I do. You see, there is this programming contest going on... </p> 
<p> Help the prime minister to find the cheapest prime path between any two given four-digit primes! The first digit must be nonzero, of course. Here is a solution in the case above. </p>
<pre>
    1033
    1733     
    3733     
    3739     
    3779
    8779
    8179     
</pre> The cost of this solution is 6 pounds. Note that the digit 1 which got pasted over in step 2 can not be reused in the last step – a new 1 must be purchased.

<h3>Input</h3> 
<p> One line with a positive number: the number of test cases (at most 100). Then for each test case, one line with two numbers separated by a blank. Both numbers are four-digit primes (without leading zeros). </p> 
<h3>Output</h3> 
<p>One line for each case, either with a number stating the minimal cost or containing the word <tt>Impossible</tt>. </p> 
<h3>Example</h3>
