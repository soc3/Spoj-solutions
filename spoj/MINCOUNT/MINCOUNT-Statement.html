<p>A triangle made of coins of height h is as follows<br> It has h coins at the base and h-1 coins one level above base and so on.(Coins are placed as shown in the figure below)<br> And at the top most level there will be only one coin<br> Now given h the task is to invert this triangle by moving minimum number of coins. For example when h=4 triangle is <br> <img src="/content/abhilash_i:invert" style="float:center" vspace="3" hspace="8" width="600" alt="Invert"><br> For h=4 at least 3 coins must be moved to invert it.<br> </p>
<h3>Input</h3> 
<p>In the first line N will be given and then N lines follow with each line having a integer which is the height of triangle in that test case.00?h&lt;10<sup>10</sup>; </p>
<h3>Output</h3> 
<p>For each test case output in a seperate line the minimum number of moves required to invert the triangle. Output fits in long long data type </p>
