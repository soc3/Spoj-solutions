<p>Determine the shortest path between the specified vertices in the graph given in the input data.<br> Hint: You can use Dijkstra's algorithm.<br> Hint 2: if you're a lazy C++ programmer, you can use set and cin/cout (with sync_with_stdio(0)) - it should suffice.<br> <br> </p>
<h3>Input</h3> 
<p>first line - one integer - number of test cases<br> For each test case the numbers V, K (number of vertices, number of edges) are given,<br> Then K lines follow, each containing the following numbers separated by a single space: <br> a<sub>i</sub>, b<sub>i</sub>, c<sub>i</sub><br> It means that the graph being described contains an edge from a<sub>i</sub> to b<sub>i</sub>,<br> with a weight of c<sub>i</sub>.<br> Below the graph description a line containing a pair of integers A, B is present.<br> The goal is to find the shortest path from vertex A to vertex B.<br> All numbers in the input data are integers in the range 0..10000.<br> </p>
<h3>Output</h3> 
<p>For each test case your program should output (in a separate line) a single number C - the length of the shortest path from vertex A to vertex B. In case there is no such path, your program should output a single word "NO" (without quotes)<br> </p>
