The question is very very simple and easier than that you cannot imagine. You have to count total number of such primes p in the range <strong>[a ? 0, b &gt; 0]</strong> so that <strong>(p<sup>2</sup> + 1) or/and (p<sup>2</sup> + 2) is/are prime(s)</strong><strong>.</strong></p> 
<h3>Input</h3> 
<p>First line of input is t, <strong>(t &lt; 100)</strong> total number of test cases. Next t lines contains two integers a and b seperated by space.<br><strong>a &lt; 50001, b &lt; 100001 and b &gt; a</strong>.</p> 
<h3>Output</h3> 
<p>In each line print total numbers of such prime numbers.</p> 
<h3>Example</h3> 
<pre><strong>Input:</strong>
2<br>0 1<br>4 5
