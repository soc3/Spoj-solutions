<p><strong>RK</strong> is a great code breaker. He knows any cipher in the world can be broken by frequency analysis. He intercepted an enemy message. The message consists of <strong>N</strong> numbers, smaller than or equal to <strong>C</strong>. RK belives freqency analysis consists of sorting this sequence so that more frequent numbers appear before less frequent ones.</p> 
<p style="font-family: verdana;">Formally, the sequence must be sorted so that given any two numbers X and Y , X appears before Y if the number of times X appears in the original sequence is larger than the number of time Y does. If the number of appearances is equal, the number whoes value appears sooner in the input should appear sooner in the sorted sequence.<br> Help RK by creating a "frequency sorter".</p> 
<p style="font-family: verdana;"><strong>INPUT</strong></p> 
<p style="font-family: verdana;">First line of input contains two integers, N (1&lt;=N&lt;=1000), length of message, and C (1&lt;=C&lt;=10^9), the number from task description. Next line contains N integers smaller than or equal to C, message itself.</p> 
<p> </p> 
<p style="font-family: verdana;"><strong>OUTPUT</strong></p> 
<p style="font-family: verdana;">First and only line of output should contain N numbers, the sorted sequence.</p> 
<p style="font-family: verdana;"><strong>SAMPLE</strong></p> 
<p style="font-family: verdana;"><strong>Input</strong><br> 9 3<br> 1 3 3 3 2 2 2 1 1<br> <strong>Output</strong><br> 1 1 1 3 3 3 2 2 2<br><br> <strong>Input</strong><br> 5 2<br> 2 1 2 1 2<br> <strong>Output</strong><br> 2 2 2 1 1</p>
