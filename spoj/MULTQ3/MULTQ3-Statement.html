<p>There are N numbers a[0],a[1]..a[N - 1]. Initally all are 0. You have to perform two types of operations :<br><br> 1) Increase the numbers between indices A and B (inclusive) by 1. This is represented by the command "0 A B"<br> 2) Answer how many numbers between indices A and B (inclusive) are divisible by 3. This is represented by the command "1 A B".<br></p> 
<h3>Input</h3> 
<p>The first line contains two integers, N and Q. Each of the next Q lines are either of the form "0 A B" or "1 A B" as mentioned above.</p> 
<h3>Output</h3> 
<p>Output 1 line for each of the queries of the form "1 A B" containing the required answer for the corresponding query.</p>
