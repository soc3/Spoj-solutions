<p>Alice and Bob need to send secret messages to each other and are discussing ways to encode their messages:</p> 
<blockquote> 
 <p> <u>Alice:</u> “Let’s just use a very simple code: We’ll assign ‘A’ the code word 1, ‘B’ will be 2, and so on down to ‘Z’ being assigned 26.”<br></p> 
 <p> <u>Bob:</u> “That’s a stupid code, Alice. Suppose I send you the word ‘BEAN’ encoded as 25114. You could decode that in many different ways!”<br> </p> 
 <p> <u>Alice:</u> “Sure you could, but what words would you get? Other than ‘BEAN’, you’d get ‘BEAAD’, ‘YAAD’, ‘YAN’, ‘YKD’ and ‘BEKD’. I think you would be able to figure out the correct decoding. And why would you send me the word ‘BEAN’ anyway?”<br> </p> 
 <p> <u>Bob:</u> “OK, maybe that’s a bad example, but I bet you that if you got a string of length 5000 there would be tons of different decodings and with that many you would find at least two different ones that would make sense.”<br> </p> 
 <p> <u>Alice:</u> “How many different decodings?”<br> </p> 
 <p> <u>Bob:</u> “Jillions!” </p> 
</blockquote> 
<p> For some reason, Alice is still unconvinced by Bob’s argument, so she requires a program that will determine how many decodings there can be for a given string using her code.</p> 
<h3>Input</h3> 
<p>Input will consist of multiple input sets. Each set will consist of a single line of at most 5000 digits representing a valid encryption (for example, no line will begin with a 0). There will be no spaces between the digits. An input line of ‘0’ will terminate the input and should not be processed.</p> 
<h3>Output</h3> 
<p>For each input set, output the number of possible decodings for the input string. All answers will be within the range of a 64 bit signed integer.</p>
