<p>Orianna is a great swimmer and she's going to a swimming competition this month and needs your help as she is highly paranoic about the results of the competition.</p> 
<p>The competition consists in some sort of evaluations, every judge makes a score and, based on that score and the score of other contestants she will get a score belonging to her results, those scores are final, meaning that will not change in the competition.</p> 
<p> Orianna requires this solution with urgency, she is getting evaluated on a lot of ways and she is very worried about her results, so she wants to know what is the worst score from an evaluation A to other evaluation B inclusive.</p> 
<h3>Input</h3> 
<p>The first line of the test data will start with an integer T representing the T test cases, then, T cases will follow, each of the cases starts with two integers N and Q, denoting the number of evaluations Orianna had, then, N integers will follow denoting the score on each evaluation, after that, Q queries will begin, each query consist on two integers A and B.</p> 
<h3>Output</h3> 
<p>You must output the string “<tt>Scenario #i:</tt>“, a blank line and then the result of each query, remember, Orianna is interested on the worst score from evaluation A to evaluation B inclusive.</p>
