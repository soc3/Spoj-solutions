<p>A common subsequence between two strings A and B is defined as 2 sets { i0 , i1 , i2 , i3 , ... , ik } { j0 , j1 , j2 , j3 , ... , jk } such that 0 &lt;= i0 &lt; i1 &lt; i2 &lt; i3 &lt; ... &lt; A.length() and 0 &lt;= j0 &lt; j1 &lt; j2 &lt; j3 &lt; ... &lt; B.length() and A[ i0 ] = B[ j0 ], A[ i1 ] = B[ j1 ] , ... , A[ ik ] = B[ jk ]. Given two strings A and B print the length of the longest common subsequence between them.</p> 
<p>i.e. "a", "d","cd" are common subsequence between the two strings "abcd" and "adcd" while "acd" is the longest common subsequence between them.</p> 
<h3>Input</h3> 
<p>First line contains a string A (1 &lt;= A.lenth() &lt;= 7).</p> 
<p>Second line contains a string B (1 &lt;= B.length() &lt;= 7).</p> 
<p>Each string is composed of lower case letters only ('a' -'z').</p> 
<h3>Output</h3> 
<p>Prints one line containing the length of the longest common subsequence.</p>

<h3>Example</h3> 
<pre><strong>Input:</strong></pre> 
<pre>abcd</pre> 
<pre>adcd

<strong>Output:</strong>
3</pre>
