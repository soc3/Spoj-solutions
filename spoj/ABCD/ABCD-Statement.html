<p>Consider a table with 2 rows and 2N columns (a total of 4N cells). Each cell of the first row is coloured by one of the colours A, B, C, D such that there are no two adjacent cells of the same colour. You have to colour the second row using colours A, B, C, D such that:</p> 
<ul> 
 <li>There are exactly N cells of each colour (A, B, C and D) in the table.</li> 
 <li>There are no two adjacent cells of the same colour. (Adjacent cells share a vertical or a horizontal side.)</li> 
</ul> 
<p>It is guaranteed that the solution, not necessarily unique, will always exist.</p> 
<h3>Input</h3> 
<p>[a natural number N ? 50000]</p> 
<p>[a string of 2N letters from the set {A, B, C, D}, representing the first row of the table]</p> 
<h3>Output</h3> 
<p>[a string of 2N letters from the set {A, B, C, D}, representing the second row of the table]</p>
