<p align="justify">Given two vessels, one of which can accommodate <em>a</em> litres of water and the other - <em>b</em> litres of water, determine the number of steps required to obtain exactly <em>c</em> litres of water in one of the vessels.</p> 
<p align="justify">At the beginning both vessels are empty. The following operations are counted as 'steps':</p> 
<div> 
 <ul> 
  <li>emptying a vessel, </li> 
  <li>filling a vessel, </li> 
  <li>pouring water from one vessel to the other, without spilling, until one of the vessels is either full or empty. </li> 
 </ul> 
</div> 
<p> </p> 
<h3>Input</h3> 
<p align="justify">An integer <em>t</em>, 1&lt;=<em>t</em>&lt;=100, denoting the number of testcases, followed by <em>t</em> sets of input data, each consisting of three positive integers <em>a, b, c</em>, not larger than 40000, given in separate lines.</p> 
<h3>Output</h3> 
<p align="justify">For each set of input data, output the minimum number of steps required to obtain c litres, or -1 if this is impossible.</p>
