<p>The government of <strong>Spoj_land</strong> has selected number of locations in the city for road construction and numbered those locations as 0,1,2,3,.......500.</p> 
<p>Now, they want to construct roads between various pairs of location(say <strong>A</strong> and <strong>B</strong> ) and have fixed the cost for travelling between those pair of locations from either end  as <strong>W </strong><strong>unit</strong>.</p> 
<p>Now , Rohit being a curious boy wants to find the minimum cost for travelling from location <strong>U</strong> (source) to <strong>Q</strong> number of other locations (destination).</p> 
<p> </p> 
<h3>Input</h3> 
<p>First line contains <strong>N</strong> ,the number of roads that government constructed.</p> 
<p>Next N line contains three integers <strong>A</strong> ,<strong>B</strong>, and <strong>W</strong>.</p> 
<p>A and B represent the locations between which the road was constructed and W is the fixed cost for travelling from A to B or from B to A.</p> 
<p>Next line contains an integer <strong>U</strong> from where Rohit wants to travel to other locations.</p> 
<p>Next line contain <strong>Q</strong> , the number of queries (finding cost) that he wants to perform.</p> 
<p>Next Q lines contain an integer <strong>V</strong> (destination) for which minimum cost is to be found <strong>from U</strong>.</p> 
<h3>Output</h3> 
<p>Print the required answer in each line.</p> 
<p>If he can't travel from location U to V by any means then, print '<strong>NO PATH</strong>' without quotes.</p>
