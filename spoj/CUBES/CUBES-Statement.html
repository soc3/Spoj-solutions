<p> For hundreds of years Fermat's Last Theorem, which stated simply that for <i>n</i> &gt; 2 there exist no integers <i>a</i>, <i>b</i>, <i>c</i> &gt; 1 such that <i>a</i>^<i>n</i> = <i>b</i>^<i>n</i> + <i>c</i>^<i>n</i>, has remained elusively unproven. (A recent proof is believed to be correct, though it is still undergoing scrutiny.) It <i>is</i> possible, however, to find integers greater than 1 that satisfy the "perfect cube" equation <i>a</i>^3 = <i>b</i>^3 + <i>c</i>^3 + <i>d</i>^3 (e.g. a quick calculation will show that the equation 12^3 = 6^3 + 8^3 + 10^3 is indeed true). This problem requires that you write a program to find all sets of numbers {<i>a</i>,<i>b</i>,<i>c</i>,<i>d</i>} which satisfy this equation for <i>a</i> &lt;= 100. </p>
<p> The output should be listed as shown below, one perfect cube per line, in non-decreasing order of a (i.e. the lines should be sorted by their <i>a</i> values). The values of <i>b</i>, <i>c</i>, and <i>d</i> should also be listed in non-decreasing order on the line itself. There do exist several values of <i>a</i> which can be produced from multiple distinct sets of <i>b</i>, <i>c</i>, and <i>d</i> triples. In these cases, the triples with the smaller <i>b</i> values should be listed first. </p>
<p> Note that the programmer will need to be concerned with an efficient implementation. The official time limit for this problem is 2 minutes, and it is indeed possible to write a solution to this problem which executes in under 2 minutes on a 33 MHz 80386 machine. Due to the distributed nature of the contest in this region, judges have been instructed to make the official time limit at their site the greater of 2 minutes or twice the time taken by the judge's solution on the machine being used to judge this problem. </p>
<p> The first part of the output is shown here: </p>
