Bar gives him the sequence of distinct positive number, and then includes the number x in the sequence. The average of the numbers is avg. If bar removes the number x from the list, the new average is avg+1. He asked the Foo to tell him the largest possible number in the sequence.</p> 
<p>Input</p> 
<p>FirstLine contain number of testcases (t &lt;=5000). </p> 
<p>Next t lines contain the number x(1&lt;=x&lt;=49999) and avg(x+1&lt;=avg&lt;=50000).</p> 
<p>Output</p> 
<p>Print the largest possible number in the sequence.</p>
