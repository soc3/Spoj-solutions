<p>Your task is to find the number of Groups from the given list of Known people. It can be proved that there is exactly only one possible way for forming the groups.<br><br></p> 
<p><strong>Input:</strong> The first line consists of an integer t, the number of test cases. For each test case, you are given an array of strings representing Known people. Known is of size NxN where N is the total number of people. <br><br></p> 
<p><strong>Output:</strong> For each test case, print the number of Groups. <br><br></p>
