 Little Tulip recently learnt  about how to  write numbers. So she wrote some numbers in a paper in a line.
</div> 
<div id="_mcePaste" style="position: absolute; left: -10000px; top: 0px; width: 1px; height: 1px; overflow: hidden;">
 But she never wrote a number which is less than the prevous one.
</div> 
<div id="_mcePaste" style="position: absolute; left: -10000px; top: 0px; width: 1px; height: 1px; overflow: hidden;">
 Now she want to know how many different numbers are in a given range.
</div> 
<div id="_mcePaste" style="position: absolute; left: -10000px; top: 0px; width: 1px; height: 1px; overflow: hidden;">
 In short , you are given an array of N integers indexed from 1 to N, and q queries, each in the form i j, you have to find the number of distinct integers from index i to j (inclusive).

<p>In short , you are given an array of N integers indexed from 1 to N, and q queries, each in the form i j, you have to find the number of distinct integers from index i to j (inclusive).</p> 
<p> </p> 
<h3>Input</h3> 
<p>Input starts with an integer T (? 15), denoting the number of test cases.</p> 
<p>The first line of a case is a blank line. The next line contains two integers N (1 ? N ? 10^5), q (1 ? q ? 10^5). The next line contains N space separated positive integers forming the array. Each of the next q lines will contain a query which is in the form i j (1 ? i ? j ? N).</p> 
<h3>Output</h3> 
<p>For each test case, print the case number in a single line. Then for each query you have to print a line containing number of distinct integers from index i to j.</p> 
<h3>Example</h3> 
<pre><strong>Input:</strong>
2

5 3
1 2 2 4 5
1 2
1 5
4 5

3 1
1 1 1
1 3


<strong>Output:</strong>
Case 1:
2
4
2
Case 2:
1</pre>
